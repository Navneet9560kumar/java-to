## 📘 Sample Learning Log

### Day 1 – Binary Search

> Binary Search is an efficient algorithm to search elements in a sorted array by dividing the search range in half repeatedly.

#### ✅ Key Concepts:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Steps:**
  1. Initialize `low` and `high` pointers.
  2. Find mid-point: `mid = (low + high) / 2`.
  3. Compare `arr[mid]` with the target.
  4. Adjust search range accordingly.

#### 📌 Applications:
- Finding element positions
- Lower and upper bounds
- Binary search on answers (in optimization problems)

## 🎯 Goal

To become a **better problem-solver** and a **well-rounded developer** by learning consistently, documenting effectively, and sharing knowledge with others.
