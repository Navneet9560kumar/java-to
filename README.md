1=>What is Binary Search?
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Time Complexity: O(log n), making it much faster than linear search (O(n)) for large datasets.
How It Works:
Start with two pointers: low (start) and high (end) at the array bounds.
Calculate the middle index: mid = (low + high) / 2.
Compare the target with arr[mid]:
(If arr[mid] == target, the target is found.
If arr[mid] < target, search the right half: update low = mid + 1.
If arr[mid] > target, search the left half: update high = mid - 1.)
Repeat until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.
Lower and Upper Bounds:
Lower Bound (L.B.): The smallest index i such that arr[i] >= target.
Upper Bound (U.B.): The smallest index i such that arr[i] > target.
Why Binary Search?
Efficiency: It reduces the search space by half each time, unlike linear search, which checks each element sequentially.
Use Case: Ideal when dealing with sorted arrays or search intervals.
